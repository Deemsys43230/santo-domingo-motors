-------
LiveKit Agents worker entrypoint for the Santo Domingo Motors AI Voice Agent
POC. Run with:

    python -m app.main dev      # local development, connects to LiveKit Cloud/OSS server
    python -m app.main start    # production worker

The Supervisor pattern:
    Every new call/session starts on `SupervisorAgent`. From there, the
    Supervisor hands the session off to SalesAgent / ServiceAgent /
    FinanceAgent (see app/agents/supervisor.py for the routing logic), and
    those agents can hand back to the Supervisor or escalate to a human.

Voice model:
    This POC uses Google's Gemini Realtime (speech-to-speech) model as a
    single combined STT+LLM+TTS engine via LiveKit's `google.beta.realtime`
    plugin -- there is no separate STT/LLM/TTS pipeline to wire up. The same
    RealtimeModel instance/config is reused by every agent in the handoff
    chain since LiveKit's AgentSession owns the model and swaps only the
    active `Agent` (instructions + tools) on handoff.
